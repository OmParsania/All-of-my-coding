    Five parties had representatives elected to the federal parliament in the 2021 election: the Liberal Party who currently form the government, the Conservative Party who are the Official Opposition, the New Democratic Party, the Bloc Québécois, and the Green Party of Canada.

    <b>
        The politics of Canada function within a framework of parliamentary democracy and a federal system of parliamentary government with strong democratic traditions. Canada is a constitutional monarchy, in which the monarch is head of state. In practice, the executive powers are directed by the Cabinet, a committee of ministers of the Crown responsible to the elected House of Commons of Canada and chosen and headed by the Prime Minister of Canada.
        Canada is described as a "full democracy", with a tradition of liberalism, and an egalitarian, moderate political ideology.

        Far-left and far-right politics have never been a prominent force in Canadian society. The traditional "brokerage" model of Canadian politics leaves little room for ideology.

        Peace, order, and good government, alongside an implied bill of rights are founding principles of the Canadian government. An emphasis on social justice has been a distinguishing 
         element of Canada's political culture. Canada has placed emphasis on equality and inclusiveness for all its people.
